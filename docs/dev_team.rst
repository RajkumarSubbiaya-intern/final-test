Dev Team Perspective: Execution & Responsibility
================================================

Task Assignment & Planning
--------------------------

The RTE or Product Manager assigns tasks to developers based on priority, ensuring that the most critical issues and enhancements are addressed first. Since these tasks are scheduled for release in the next software iteration, careful planning and adherence to timelines are essential to maintain a smooth development cycle and meet delivery commitments. 

Developer's Responsibilities
-----------------------------
- **Timely Completion**: Once assigned, developers are expected to complete tasks within the planned sprint.

- **Proactive Communication**:
  
  - If any planning discrepancies arise, **developers must immediately notify RTE/Product Manager**.
  - Developers must **keep RTE/PdM in the loop** throughout the task to ensure release planning stays on track.

- **Ownership of Updates**:
  
  - **It is not RTE/PdM's responsibility to follow up** on each step of the task.
  - **Developers must update stakeholders** on significant task milestones and blockers.

Collaboration & Escalation
---------------------------

- Developers should **escalate roadblocks early** to prevent last-minute delays.
- Regular sync-ups with the team ensure alignment with the sprint goals.
