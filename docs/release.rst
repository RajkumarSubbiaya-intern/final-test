Release Management & Deployment
===============================
Release planning begins with bundling bugs, features, and improvements into a structured release cycle, ensuring that each update is well-coordinated and aligned with business priorities. The RTE works closely with the DevOps team to establish deployment timelines, balancing stability with the need for continuous improvements. During release execution, all code changes undergo rigorous CI/CD testing, followed by pre-release validation from both QA and L2 to ensure functionality and reliability. After deployment, L2 actively monitors system behaviour to validate the release's effectiveness, promptly identifying and addressing any post-release issues to maintain system stability.
